This is the framework for homework #3. 

The assignment is due: **Monday, April  24 at 11:59PM (EST)**

### Part 1: Behaviors

The goal of this assignment is to enable the steering behavioral animation of agents.

We represent an agent as a two-dimensional disk with mass (**m**) and moment-of-inertia (**I**) that is capable of generating a force **F** along body x-axis with a torque about the z-axis. For this assignment assume that the agent only translates in the world x-y plane and rotates about the body z-axis.

**(a) - 10 points** : Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. Implement the function *SIMAgent::FindDeriv()*. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called.

Description of agent state vector and input vector:  
* state[0] is the position of the agent in local body coordinates (almost useless in this project);  
* state[1] is the orientation angle of the agent with respect to world (i.e. global) coordinates;  
* state[2] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates.  
* state[3] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates. 
* input[0] is the force in local body coordinates;  
* input[1] is the torque in local body coordinates

You will need to set deriv[0], deriv[1], deriv[2], deriv[3]. Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called. 
* deriv[2] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates
* deriv[3] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates
* deriv[0] is the force in local body coordinates divided by the mass.
* deriv[1] is the torque in local body coordinates divided by the inertia.

You also must implement *SIMAgent::InitValues()*: Try to figure out appropriate values for control and behavior settings. You need to find out appropriate values for: *SIMAgent::Kv0, SIMAgent::Kp1, SIMAgent::Kv1, SIMAgent::KArrival, SIMAgent::KDeparture,
SIMAgent::KNoise,	SIMAgent::KWander, SIMAgent::KAvoid, SIMAgent::TAvoid, SIMAgent::RNeighborhood, SIMAgent::KSeparate, SIMAgent::KAlign, SIMAgent::KCohesion.*


**(b) - 20 points**: In this part of the assignment you will need to implement 6 types of individual behaviors and 5 types of group behaviors. Create the following behaviors through appropriate computation of V<sub> d</sub>  and Î¸<sub>d</sub>  commands:
* Seek
* Flee
* Arrival
* Departure
* Wander
* Obstacle Avoidance

**(c) - 20 points**: Implement the functions for the following group behaviors: 
* Seperation
* Cohesion 
* Alignment 
* Flocking
* Leader Following

# Part 2 - Simulating a simple pedestrian flow

**(a) - 0 points**: Follow the Anylogic example for the [Subway Entrance example](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/tutorial/Subway_Entrance.html). Create the appropriate [boundaries and walls](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/markup/Wall.html), and the display ther pedestrian density map, [statistics](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?nav=/4_1_5), [2D and 3D animations](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/reference/Animation.html).

Statistics:

**(b) - 20 points**: Create a maze. Generate the pdm, stats, and animations like before. Vary [parameters in your agents](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/reference/Attributes.html) to give them different behaviors and show the pedistrians change how they navigate the maze.


The map used in this exercise was Tolman's Maze (Tolman & Honzik, 1930; Tolman, 1948), originally used for psychology experiments of rats.  

Using AnyLogic, the image below displays 2D, 3D animations, as well as the Pedestrian Density Map.

As seen below, 8 "False Paths" were given to the pedestrians with varying degrees of probabilities for taking the false paths and true path.

**(c) - 30 points**: Model and analyze a building (or floor/outdoor space/stadium) on campus. (There is help on piazza how to find rough building plans - we expect something plausible). Create a senario: evacuation, daily office routine, special event, normal egress.... etc., and model and design your own experiment to determine if the building design suits the needs of its users. Start with photographs of your site, describe your site, describe your senario and hypothesis. Then use an agent-based pedistrian simulation to visualize your experiment's results.
